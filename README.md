# Dabbu Server

[![Code Style and Build Check](https://github.com/gamemaker1/dabbu-server/actions/workflows/style_and_build_check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gamemaker1/dabbu-server/actions/workflows/style_and_build_check.yml)

A unified API platform to access your emails, photos, and chats as simple files and folders.

## Intro

Tired of having your files and folders randomly scattered about online with multiple providers like Google Drive and One Drive? Want to access all your files and folders using a single, unified interface? Dabbuâ€™s APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow you to access your files and folders from any provider (Google Drive, Gmail, Microsoft OneDrive, etc) from a single, unified interface. Behind these APIs is a software layer that connects to these providers and returns your files and folders in one unified format. We'll let this GIF do the talking:

What you just saw there was Dabbu CLI in action - a simple program in javascript that leverages the Dabbu API to bring your files and folders at your fingertips from all over the web.

**This repo contains the server application that handles API calls from clients. The source for the CLI app demoed in the GIF above can be found [here](https://github.com/gamemaker1/dabbu-cli).**

## Getting started

The installation can be done manually on Linux, MacOS, Android (Requires Termux) and Windows.

- First, download the proper executable for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/gamemaker1/dabbu-server/releases). (Caution: releases may not work on certain versions of Android, depending on the manafacturer and version.)

- On Windows, simply double click on the file to run it.

- On Linux/MacOS, run the following command in a terminal (assuming you have downloaded the executable to your Downloads folder):

  - On MacOS:

    ```sh
    $ ~/Downloads/dabbu-server-macos
    ```

  - On Linux:

    ```sh
    $ ~/Downloads/dabbu-server-linux
    ```

- Your server is now running! To check, go to http://localhost:8080/. You will see the text `Dabbu Server running on port 8080` on the page. If not, try running the server again or check if you have missed a step. If the problem persists, post a message on [Github discussions](https://github.com/gamemaker1/dabbu-server/discussions/categories/q-a) asking for help. We'll only be glad to help you :)

## Updating the server

To update the server, simply download the new version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/gamemaker1/dabbu-server/releases).

## Installing clients to call the Dabbu API

Here is a list of clients that use the Dabbu API to interact with your files and folders:
