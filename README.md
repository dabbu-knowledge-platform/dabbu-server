# Dabbu Files API Server

[![Code Style and Build Check](https://github.com/dabbu-knowledge-platform/files-api-server/actions/workflows/style_and_build_check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.comdabbu-knowledge-platform/files-api-server/actions/workflows/style_and_build_check.yml)

An implementation of the Dabbu Files API that enables you to access your files, folders and emails stored with multiple providers as simple files and folders, all in one place!

## Intro

Tired of having your files and folders randomly scattered about online with multiple providers like Google Drive and One Drive? Want to access all your files and folders using a single, unified interface? Dabbuâ€™s APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow you to access your files and folders from any provider (Google Drive, Gmail, Microsoft OneDrive, etc) from a single, unified interface. Behind these APIs is a software layer that connects to these providers and returns your files and folders in one unified format. We'll let this GIF do the talking:

What you just saw there was Dabbu CLI in action - a simple program in javascript that leverages the Dabbu API to bring your files and folders at your fingertips from all over the web.

**This repo contains the server application that handles API calls from clients. The source for the CLI app demoed in the GIF above can be found [here](https://github.com/dabbu-knowledge-platform/cli).**

## Getting started

The installation can be done manually on Linux, MacOS, Android (Requires Termux) and Windows.
